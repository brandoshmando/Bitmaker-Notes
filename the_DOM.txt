The DOM...dom dom....
---------------------

DOM == The Document Object Model
  - Provides a structure where everything on an html page as an object in a tree

  Window Object:
    - Shows properties like .location, .history, .document

  Document Object:
    - Represents the entirety of HTMl
    - Has children; aware of everyhting within html body tag
    - Can be accessed on its own without window if need be
    - Children of documents = nodes; nodes can have nodes!!
    - Three methods to access these nodes with POJ:
      * getElementById (singular because Id)
        - selects with id
      * getElementByClassName
        - selects with class name
        - use [index number] syntax to select specific items within class
      * getElementsByTagName
        - selects with html tag
    - Create elements with createElement (not inserted yet)
    - Insert by calling someVariable.appendChild(some varibale that contains element you created)
    - After selecting an object and assigning it to a variable, you can manipulate the object using its attributes as methods to change things ie picture.src = different than og src
    -style is an object itself and has its own methods to be called on it ie picture.style.border = some border styling

    Some code:
    //Insert new paragraph
    var newParagraph = document.createElement('p')
    var myText = document.createTextNode("Happy Day")
    newParagraph.appendChild(myText)

JQuery
  - Inlude external jquery lib in script tag of html
  - When speaking to JQ lib, start with $ or JQuery
  - Can use any css selector vs id, class, or tag
   * var myDiv = $('.potato')    vs in JS var myDiv = document.getElementById('potato');
   * vat myPicture = $('#picture')

  Some Code:
  //Acts somewhat like a regex...
    var p = $('p:contains("This is a paragraph"))
    p.siblings(); returns siblings
    p.parent(); returns parent

  //Manipulate CSS
  var kitten = $('some image')
  kitten.css('border') returns value for css border element
  kitten.css('border', '10px solid red') sets css for that item

  //Manipulate HTML attributes
  kitten.attr('title', 'Kitties!') Adds title to image

  var p = $('some paragraph you select')
  p.text('new text!')

  Also has methods like .html and insert new html...

  //Clone (handy method)
  var newPar = $('p').clone; Created new dom element but not yet appended
  newPar.text("Another paragraph"); sets new text
  $('body').prepend(newPar); gets inserted above last comment
