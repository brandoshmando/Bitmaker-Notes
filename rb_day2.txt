METHODS
	-A method is an executable block of code which can be used over and over again
	-DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself
	-A way for different objects to interact with each other

SCOPE
	-Can't access all methods from anywhere in a program

IMPLICIT AND EXPLCIT RETURN

	-Implicit: Methods return the last line implicitly
	-Explicit: Manually returning a value by calling return 

	Explicit return not commonly used, but good example is within a while loop to return a value, and if that value matches the conditional in the while loop, it will skip the rest of the code and move on. 

ARRAYS
	-Call uniq on an array with several of the same value and it will output the uniq values
	-Array.new(3, "Matz") => ["Matz", "Matz", "Matz"]

ENUMERABLE
	-A module with methods that is included in both Hashes and Arrays. Generally iterators of some sort. Enables ruby to stick with DRY pinciples. 
	-map: returns values of the code applied within the block vs each which returns original values. Don't use puts with map!

HASHES
	-When trying to access a key that has not yet been defined, it will not throw an error, but instead show nil
	-Setting Default Value: Pass argument to Hash.new eg Hash.new("default value") In this case, when trying to access a key that has not been created, it will return the default value.
