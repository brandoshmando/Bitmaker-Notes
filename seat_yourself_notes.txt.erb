Business Logic and Approaching a New Project
--------------------------------------------

Step 1: What does the app need to do?
  - User stories
    * As a...
    * I want...
    * So that...

  - Who's the user?
  - What do they need to do or trying to do?
  - Why do they need it? What is the foal they're trying to accomplish?
  - Be CLEAR. "I want to recieve reservations" "What are reservations??"
  Ex in the context of Seat yourself clone:
    As a customer, I want to seach for restaurants
    As a customer, I want to search for reviews
    As a customer, I want to know what's nearby
                  , I want to be able to make a reservation
                  , I want to filter by cuisine
                  , I want to see a menu
                  , I want to be able to make an account
    As an owner, I want to recieve reservations
                , I want to know how many reservations I have
                , I want to be able to see what customers are searching for in my area
    NEED TO HAVE

    NICE TO HAVE

    HAPPY TO HAVE

Step 2: Planning
  - Make Assumptions
    * Set max occupancy (not limiting to table sizes. If max is 100, restaurant is full)
    * All revervations have the same duration (1h)
  - Simplify
    * Still meets the requirements of the user
  - Make mockups
    * Maybe ideas for how user flows through  the app
    * Visualize what the app will look like
    * Gather Feedback
    * Usability
    * Reveals missed user stories
    * Paper and pen/white board or Basalmiq (low res mock up)
    Note: Scientifically proven that showing a client a photoshop mock up will decrease the liklihood that they will disagree with the idea because there is a perception that you put a ton of time into it. You want the client to feel comfy when critquiing and conveying what they would like

Step 3: Modelling
  - Whiteboard/pen and paper
  - Create models
  - Draw out relationships
  - Repeat
