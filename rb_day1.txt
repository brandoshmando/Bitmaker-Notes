Ruby is:

-a programming language high level
-a interpretive language: no comiliers. Does runtime and compilation in one step. Makes it a little slower, but easy to use/write
-object oriented...everything is an object! (Has methods, instances etc)

Numbers:
	Both of these fall under classInteger:
	-Fixnum
	-Bignum
	Float is a class in itself. Somewhat unpredictable.  Use decimal to be more precise

Operators:
	== will always be a boolean (true/false)

Strings:
	" " v ' ': Double quotes enables string interpolation

Variables:
	Assign multiple variables at once 
		ex: first_variable, second_variable = 10, 20ex

Control Structures:
	if statements-
		-conditional; if true, execute code
	unless-
		- opposite of if statement 
		ex: unless x == 10
			puts "x isn't true"
	LOOPS
	while loop-
		-passes condition until statement is true
	until-
		-very similar to while
		ex: until something == x
			counter -=

	iterator def: a method that will enable you to run a block of code on any group of data eg array, hash, string etc.
